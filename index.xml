      <description>Statement on Rail Operations Maintenance Facility The Creekside PTA expresses its concern about the potential negative impacts of a Rail Operations Maintenance Facility (ROMF) in such close proximity to a school, as well as the lack of substantive communication with the school community during the planning process.
The Creekside PTA calls upon local leaders to immediately identify representatives to join a formal body that will work together to resolve concerns around potential impacts on student safety and quality of the learning environment.</description>

      <description>General information about the ROMF facility distributed at the Feburary 2018 meeting  All light rail trains will be stored, tested, and maintained at this location. This is not a light rail station, it is an industrial railyard maintenance facility. The ROMF will operate 24&amp;frasl;7. Creekside Elementary is approximately 350 yards from the proposed site. According to a mapping evaluation conducted by parents, Creekside Elementary will be closer to a ROMF than any other school in the country.</description>
