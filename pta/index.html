<h1 id="statement">Statement on Rail Operations Maintenance Facility</h1>

<p>The Creekside PTA expresses its concern about the potential negative impacts of a Rail Operations Maintenance Facility (ROMF) in such close proximity to a school, as well as the lack of substantive communication with the school community during the planning process.</p>

<p>The Creekside PTA calls upon local leaders to immediately identify  representatives to join a formal body that will work together to resolve concerns around potential impacts on student safety and quality of the learning environment. This body would meet regularly and openly and include representation from Durham Public Schools, Creekside PTA, Creekside Administration, Go Triangle, and government officials.</p>

<h1 id="infosheet">ROMF Advocacy Committee Background Information Sheet</h1>

<p>Durham-Orange Light Rail Operation and Maintenance Facility (ROMF)</p>

<p>On December 3, 2018, the Durham City Council voted to approve the rezoning of land at the intersection of Farrington Road and Ephesus Church Road from residential to light industrial to allow for the construction of the ROMF for the Durham-Orange Light Rail Transit project.</p>

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION about the ROMF FACILITY:</p>

<ul>
<li>All light rail trains will be stored, tested, and maintained at this location.</li>
<li>This is not a light rail station, it is an industrial railyard maintenance facility.</li>
<li>The ROMF will operate <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.</li>
<li>Creekside Elementary is approximately 350 yards from the proposed site.</li>
<li>According to a mapping evaluation conducted by parents, Creekside Elementary
will be closer to a ROMF than any other school in the country. The second
closest is the Charlotte ROMF, where a middle school is 756.8 yards (2,270 ft),
more than double the distance.</li>
<li>The trees that separate Farrington Rd from I-40 will be cleared for the ROMF.
(Source: GoTriangle. &lsquo;Questions and Answers about the GoTriange Rail Operations
and Maintenance Facility.&rsquo; November 1, 2018).</li>
</ul>

<p>HISTORY OF KEY DECISIONS:</p>

<ul>
<li>July 2015: The Farrington Road site is selected for the ROMF. Four other sites
were considered, including locations at Cornwallis Road, Leigh Village, Patterson
Place, and the Duke Eye Center. (Source: GoTriangle. Ch. 8. &lsquo;Evaluation of
Alternatives,&rsquo; in &lsquo;Durham-Orange Light Rail Transit Project: Combined
Environmental Impact Statement.&rsquo; February 2016.)</li>
<li>October 9, 2018: Durham Planning Commission did not vote in favor of rezoning
the Farrington Rd site to light industrial (4 YES-4 NO). (Source and Report: City
and County of Durham. &lsquo;Consolidated Staff Report: ROMF.&rsquo; October 9, 2018.</li>
<li>October 2018: Noise and Vibration Technical report is issued (see below).</li>
<li>December 3, 2018: City Council voted to approve rezoning (see above).</li>
</ul>

<p>NOISE RELATED INFORMATION:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vibration noise, train horns, warning signals, and break squeal noises will occur at the ROMF. The Noise and Vibration Technical Report states that the &lsquo;tight radius curves within the proposed ROMF have the potential to cause wheel squeal as the radii of curvature are less than 100 times the width of the LRT trucks. The SEL at 50 feet for LRT wheel squeal is assumed to be 136 dBA and each train movement is assumed to generate five seconds of wheel squeal.&rsquo;
(Source: GoTriangle. &lsquo;Noise and Vibration Technical Report.&rsquo; October 2018., p.
29, 5.1.2)</li>
<li>Creekside was not included in the noise testing sites because it lies outside the
FTA recommended distance of 650 ft for ROMF, 350 ft for tracks. This means
there is no data related how the noises from the ROMF will impact the Creekside
community. (Source for recommended distances: FTA. &lsquo;Transit Noise and
Vibration Impact Assessment Manual.&rsquo; September 2018).</li>
<li>GoTriangle has offered the following mitigation measures: to place a 4 ft berm
between the ROMF and Farrington Rd, as well as plant 8 ft ornamental trees,
spaced 16 ft apart. GoTriangle also cites the ROMF buildings themselves as
noise buffers. GoTriangle indicated at the Planning Commission meeting that it
was not possible to raise the buffer.</li>
</ul>

<p>HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INFORMATION:</p>

<ul>
<li>According to a document shared from another ROMF (shared with neighbors by GoTriangle) the facility will store and transport 144 chemicals in volumes ranging from household size to 1,000-gallon oil tanks (maximum). Many of these
chemicals are hazardous, inflammable, and/or potentially explosive petroleum
products. (Source: GoTriangle. &lsquo;ROMF Fluids &amp; Miscellaneous Materials Table.&rsquo;
November 12, 2018).</li>
<li>There are no specific emergency response plans or evacuation area estimates in the event of an explosion, spill or ground contamination.</li>
</ul>

<p>TRAFFIC INFORMATION:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is an at-grade (at street level) crossing planned for Farrington Rd.</li>
<li>Traffic will be halted at at-grade crossings for 50 seconds for each train crossing; There will be approximately 150 crossings per day at each at-grade crossing.</li>
<li>There is no plan to add additional traffic lanes on Farrington Rd (outside of
turning lanes and bike lanes).</li>
</ul>

<p>COMMUNICATION ABOUT THE ROMF:</p>

<ul>
<li>There have been several GoTriangle meetings at Creekside since August 2015
for members of the surrounding community, but there were no formal invitations
to Creekside parents for these meetings.</li>
<li>Parents sought a meeting with GoTriangle in advance of the December 3, 2018, public hearing and City Council vote; the meeting was held on December 1, 2018, at South Regional Library.</li>
<li>Creekside administration has indicated that the &lsquo;school is not taking a position on the proposed light rail and ROMF on Farrington Road.&rsquo; The administration noted that the &lsquo;school is attending community meetings to gather information&rsquo; and that &lsquo;if there is information that something will impact the school (positively or negatively), admin. will work with district officials to problem-solve as necessary.&rsquo;
