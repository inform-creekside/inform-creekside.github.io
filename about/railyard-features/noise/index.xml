      <description>GoTriangle documents sources of noise from the railyard operations maintenance facility (ROMF) in their October 2018 &amp;lsquo;noise and vibration technical report&amp;rsquo;.
 The 2018 report mentions the following ROMF noise sources:
 Wheel squeal  &amp;lsquo;tight radius curves within the proposed ROMF have the potential to cause wheel squeal&amp;rsquo;  &amp;lsquo;SEL at 50 feet for LRT wheel squeal is assumed to be 136 dBA&amp;lsquo;   Power substation  &amp;lsquo;proposed substation within the ROMF is assumed to operate continuously&amp;rsquo;  &amp;lsquo;SEL at 50 feet of 99 dBA&amp;rsquo;   Tree removal  &amp;lsquo;removal of up to 600 feet of intervening trees from the proposed ROMF site between Interstate 40 and sensitive receptors west of Farrington Road&amp;rsquo;  &amp;lsquo;assumed to increase existing highway noise from Interstate 40 by 10 dB&amp;rsquo;   Train movements  &amp;lsquo;The schedule of LRT train movements within the ROMF is assumed to be as follows&amp;rsquo;:  Daytime movements (7:00 AM to 10:00 PM): 32 total movements Nighttime movements (10:00 PM to 7:00 AM): 48 total movements    The 2015 noise report assumes the ROMF will operate at &amp;lsquo;SEL at 50 feet&amp;rsquo; of 111 dBA (Table 3, page 19).</description>

      <description>The GoTriangle 2018 noise report describes ways to mitigate (reduce) the noise:
 ROMF buildings: 5 dB berms: 10 dBA train wheel treatments: 2 dBA train design changes: 5 dBA  The GoTriangle 2015 noise report describes another way to mitigate wheel squeal, absent from the 2018 report.
 &amp;lsquo;Resilient/damped wheels are incorporated into project design to reduce wheel squeal noise 10-20 decibels.&amp;rsquo;   No written updates have followed the October 2018 noise report as of February 2018.</description>

      <description>GoTriangle estimated noise levels for areas near the railyard operations maintenance facility site based on long term noise monitoring sites nowhere near the ROMF site, west of I-40.  Closest long-term noise monitoring sites closest to Creekside and west of I-40 were:  214 Celeste Circle, Chapel Hill (LT-4) 4315 Randall Road, Durham (LT-5)    Annotated map of noise monitoring sites from noise report</description>
