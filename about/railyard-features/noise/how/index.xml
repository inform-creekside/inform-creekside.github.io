      <description>Guidelines for evaluating the noise impact of a maintenance facility near a school may specify certain screening distances to select schools, but they are &amp;lsquo;NOT a substitute for case- and site-specific evaluation of potential risks and hazards&amp;rsquo;. These distances may not be a good predictor of an environmental hazard.
 Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) guidelines mention
 that &amp;lsquo;a maintenance facility near a school&amp;rsquo; (p. 33) is one location recommended for a &amp;lsquo;Detailed Noise Analysis&amp;rsquo;  The &amp;lsquo;screening distance for noise assessments&amp;rsquo; at a school is  1,000 feet for unobstructed distances 650 feet for obstructed distances (&amp;lsquo;with intervening buildings&amp;rsquo;)    According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) school siting guidelines</description>

      <description>Children spend a large part of their day at school. Understanding any increases in the noise footprint at Creekside Elementary school caused by the railyard operation maintenance facility (ROMF) is important. A growing body of evidence points towards an association between chronic environmental noise exposure (including noise from rail) and declines in a child&amp;rsquo;s cognitive performance. To acheive this end, environmental noise is not at levels that cause hearing loss.</description>
