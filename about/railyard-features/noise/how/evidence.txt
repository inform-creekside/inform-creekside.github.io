Children spend a large part of their day at school. Understanding any  increases in the [noise footprint](https://www.ted.com/talks/mathias_basner_why_noise_is_bad_for_your_health_and_what_you_can_do_about_it?utm_source=tedcomshare&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tedspread) caused by the railyard operation maintenance facility (ROMF) is important. A growing body of evidence points towards an association between [chronic environmental noise exposure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4390126/) (including noise from rail) and declines in a [child's cognitive performance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14757721).

Many studies have demonstrated the negative impact of environmental noise exposure on children. "...children with chronic aircraft, road traffic, or rail noise exposure at school have poorer reading ability, memory, and performance on national standardised tests than do children who are not exposed to noise at school." [Basner et al 2014](https:/doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61613-X)

More than 20 studies have shown environmental noise exposure has a negative effect on children’s learning outcomes and cognitive performance,57 and that children with chronic aircraft, road traffic, or rail noise exposure at school have poorer reading ability, memory, and performance on national standardised tests than do children who are not exposed to noise at school.58–60 Investigators have examined exposure–effect links between noise exposure and cognition to identify the exposure level at which noise effects begin.61,62 The RANCH study of 2844 children aged 9–10 years attending 89 schools around Heathrow (London, UK), Schiphol (Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and Madrid-Barajas (Spain) airports showed a linear exposure–effect relation between aircraft noise exposure at school and a child’s reading comprehension and recognition memory after adjusting for a range of socioeconomic factors.61,62 A LAeq 5 dB increase in aircraft noise exposure was associated with a 2 month delay in reading age in children in the UK and a 1 month delay in those in the Netherlands. These linear associations suggest that there is no threshold for effects and any reduction in noise level at school should improve a child’s cognition.
