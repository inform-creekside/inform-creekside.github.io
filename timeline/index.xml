      <description>From 2012 to 2018, the school district, GoTriangle and the City/County government sytematically failed to inform parents and guardians at Creekside Elementary of the public zoning hearings and public comment periods for the rail yard site selection. As a result, almost all people with children at Creekside Elementary did not have a chance to participate in the site selection process.
   Date Topic Detail Any direct contact of Creekside parents by the school district or GoTriangle?</description>
